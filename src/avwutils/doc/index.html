Miscellaneous FSL Image Utilities
<TD ALIGN=RIGHT><a href="../index.html"><IMG BORDER=0 SRC="../images/fsl-logo.jpg"></a></TR></TABLE><HR>
 
<P>FSLUTILS is a set of useful command-line utilities which allow the
conversion, processing etc. of Analyze and Nifti format data sets.
Many of them work on both 3D and 4D data. For each of these programs,
<i>type just the program name to get the usage help</i>.


<p>The different FSLUTILS programs are:
<UL>

<LI><b>fsl2ascii</b> - convert image files to ASCII text file (or files if
data is 4D).

<br><br><LI><b>fslcc</b> - run cross-correlations between every volume in
one 4D data set with every volume in another (for investigating
similarities in ICA outputs).

<br><br><LI><b>fslchfiletype</b> - used to change the file type of
an image (e.g. from ANALYZE_GZ to NIFTI).  The first argument is
the desired file type (one of ANALYZE, ANALYZE_GZ, NIFTI, NIFTI_GZ,
NIFTI_PAIR, NIFTI_PAIR_GZ) and the second is the input file.  If
no third argument is given then the input file is converted in place.
This in place conversion removes the original files: e.g. for an
Analyze file called stdimg then
<kbd>fslchfiletype NIFTI_GZ stdimg</kbd> would replace stdimg.hdr and
stdimg.img with stdimg.nii.gz.  Note that having multiple copies of
an image with the same basename and different filetypes (e.g. stdimg.nii.gz
and stdimg.hdr and stdimg.img) creates many problems for determining
what images to read, and in general will cause FSL programs to stop.

<br><br><a name="fslcomplex"></a><LI><b>fslcomplex</b> - a utility that allows 3D or 4D complex
image files to be split or constructed from corresponding real
components (either Cartesian or polar). The initial flag indicates
what kind of processing is done.  In addition, two optional arguments
at the end specify the first and last 3D volumes to be processed when
the input is 4D (default is to do all volumes).

<br><br><LI><b>fslcpgeom</b> - copy certain parts of the header 
information (image
dimensions, voxel dimensions, voxel dimensions units string, image
orientation/origin or qform/sform info) from one image to another.
Note that only copies from Analyze to Analyze or Nifti to Nifti
will work properly.  Copying from different files will result in
loss of information or potentially incorrect settings.

<br><br><LI><b>fslcreatehd</b> - creates a new image header along with
a zero intensity data image.  There are two forms of input: one takes
a list of minimal information on the command line, the other takes in
an xml-style file, as written by <kbd>fslhd -x</kbd>.  The information
required in the first version is: x/y/z/tsize for image dimensions,
x/y/zvoxsize for voxel dimensions (eg in mm), tr in seconds for time
between volumes (for 3D data set to 0), x/y/zorigin for voxel
co-ordinate origin (eg for standard space - otherwise leave as 0 0 0),
datatype for the voxel data type (the commonest are: 1=binary,
2=unsigned char, 4=signed short, 8=signed int, 16=float).  Note that
this is <b><i>different</i></b> from the previous versions in that an
entire image is created, and will <b><i>overwrite</i></b> any
<kbd>.img</kbd> file contents of the same image name.

<br><br><LI><b>fsledithd</b> - allows the header information in
and image to be edited in a text-based xml-style format (like the
output of <kbd>fslhd -x</kbd> but with redundant fields removed
and some help text provided).  Note that
the default text editor used is nano, but other editors can be
specified by the second argument.

<br><br><LI><b>fslfft</b> - outputs the Fast-Fourier Transform (or inverse)
for a complex input volume.

<br><br><LI><b>fslhd</b> - report every field of an Analyze or Nifti
header (note that the fields are different although some are common,
e.g. pixdims).  The option "-x" produces an xml-style output which can
be used in conjunction with <kbd>fslcreatehd</kbd>.  The reported
values are those used internally in FSL programs and are sometimes
different from the raw values stored in the file to avoid incorrect
settings (e.g. dimN has a minimum value of 1, not 0).

<br><br><LI><b>fslinfo</b> - report a basic subset of an Analyze or
Nifti header.

<br><br><LI><b>fslinterleave</b> - interleave two inputs to form a
combined image.

<br><br><LI><b>fslmaths</b> - simple but powerful program to allow
mathematical manipulation of images.  Now includes spatial and
temporal filtering, statistic conversion (e.g. z to p-values),
diffusion tensor decomposition, and TFCE calculation.

<br><br><LI><b>fslmeants</b> - output the average timeseries of a set of voxels, or the individual time series for each of these voxels.

<br><br><LI><b>fslmerge</b> - concatenate image files into a single
output. This concatenation can be in time, or in X, Y or Z. All image
dimensions (except for the one being concatenated over) must be the
same in all input images. For example, this can be used to take
multiple 3D files (eg as output by SPM) and create a single 4D image
file.

<br><br><LI><b>fslnvols</b> - report how many time points are in the
input 4D data set.

<br><br><LI><b>fslpspec</b> - outputs the spectral power density of an
input 4D data set.

<br><br><LI><b>fslroi</b> - extract region of interest (ROI) from an
image. You can a) take a 3D ROI from a 3D data set (or if it is 4D,
the same ROI is taken from each time point and a new 4D data set is
created), b) extract just some time points from a 4D data set, or c)
control time and space limits to the ROI.  Note that the arguments are
minimum index and <i>size</i> (not maximum index).  So to extract
voxels 10 to 12 inclusive you would specify 10 and 3 (not 10 and 12).

<br><br><LI><b>fslslice</b> - split a 3D file into lots of 2D files (along z-axis).

<br><br><LI><b>fslsplit</b> - split a 4D file into lots of 3D files
(eg for inputting to SPM).

<br><br><LI><b>fslstats</b> - report certain summary statistics for an
input 3D/4D image. Of particular value is the "robust intensity range"
which calculates values similar to the 2% and 98% percentiles, but
ensuring that the majority of the intensity range is captured, even
for binary images. In addition, it can take an aribitrary mask as
input so that statistics are only calculated within the mask and can
also generate histogram data.

<br><br><LI><b>fslval</b> - report a particular parameter (given a
particular keyword eg "dim4") from an image header. To see the list of
keywords run <kbd>fslhd</kbd> on the header and look at the first column.

</ul>

<h2>Orientation-related Utilities</h2>

<p> Orientation, labelling and getting left and right correct are
important but often confusing issues.  You should always look at your
data and check if the labels in FSLView are correct.  <b><i>No further
analysis should ever be done if the labels in FSLView are incorrect or
missing.</i></b> If your labels are fine then you probably will not
need to use any other these tools, although
<code>fslreorient2std</code> may be useful. If not, then you will need
to read on. We have tried to simplify the usage of the tools for
common tasks involving orientation issues, although still providing
flexible and powerful tools for the expert user.

<p>
<b>Common problems</b>
<br>We describe here the most common problems and how to solve
them. If you have a different problem then you will need to work
with the advanced tools described later (and read the information on
NIfTI orientation).
<ol>
  <li> <b>The labels in FSLView are wrong or missing</b>
  <br>  This is <i>very serious</i> and needs to be fixed before doing
  any analysis at all.  Ideally it should be fixed by using a
  tool that creates a correct NIfTI file. There are numerous
  converters from DICOM to NIfTI -- for recommendations, see the
   <a href="http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fslfaq">FSL FAQ</a>.
  A correct converter should store the correct information in the
  NIfTI file so that the labels are correct when viewed in FSLView.
  If you have tried many converters and still cannot get the images
  converted correctly then you will need to use the advanced tools,
  <code>fslswapdim</code> and <code>fslorient</code>, to fix the
  problem (more info below). 
  <li> <b>The labels in FSLView are correct but the image is oriented
  "wrongly"</b>
  <br> By default FSLView shows the image in the way that the scanner
  acquired it, so that sagittal, coronal and axial scans look very
  different. Hence this is not really "wrong" - just how FSLView
  chooses to display the images.  If you do not want this but want to
  see the image in the same orientation as the standard templates
  (MNI152) then you can run the tool <code>fslreorient2std</code>
  which is designed for just this task.  However, make sure that the
  labels are correct in FSLView to start with, as this tool only works if they are correct.
</ol>

<!---
The following utilities allow you to report and modify the
orientation information in NIFTI files (and ANALYZE to some extent).
For more information about orientation and the NIFTI format see
the <a href="http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fslfaq">FSL FAQ</a>.
!--->

<p>
<b>Tools</b>
<ul>
  <LI><b>fslreorient2std</b> - this is a simple tool designed to
  reorient an image to match the orientation of the standard template
  images (MNI152) so that they appear "the same way around" in
  FSLView. It requires that the image labels are correct in FSLView
  before this is run.  It is also not a registration tool, so it will
  not align the image to standard space, it will only apply 90,
  180 or 270 degree rotations about the different axes as necessary to
  get the labels in the same position as the standard template.

  <br><br><LI><b>fslorient</b> - this is an advanced tool that reports
or sets the orientation information in a file.  Note that only in
NIfTI files can the orientation be changed - Analyze files are
<i>always treated as "radiological"</i> (meaning that they could
be simply rotated into the same alignment as the <code>MNI152</code> standard
images - equivalent to the appropriate <i>sform</i> or <i>qform</i> in
a NIfTI file having a negative determinant).

<p>In nifti files it is possible to independently report or modify
the <i>qform</i> or <i>sform</i> fields (see below for background
  information on NIfTI orientation).  However, the FSL4.1 output
routines will try to keep
<i>qform and sform matrices the same</i> whenever one would otherwise
be unset.  Therefore it is not possible, for instance, to delete only
the qform, as if the sform is set then doing this will result in the
qform being set equal (as close as possible) to the sform.  This is
currently done to aid interoperability with other packages.  However, if both
qform and sform are given different values then these are
preserved by the output routines.

<p>This command does not change the data storage at all - only the
orientation information in the header and so should be used with great
  caution.  Only modify header information if you understand the
  information about the NIfTI orientation given below or are following
  (exactly) a set of steps prescribed by someone who does.

<p>The option <code>-deleteorient</code> is useful for the first stage
of correcting orientation/label information in images where the
conversion to NIfTI does not provide the correction information.  Note
that the first, and by far the best, solution to this problem is to
find a method of converting the images to NIfTI in a way that
correctly stores the information (see above) but if this really is
not possible then a combination of <code>fslorient</code> and
<code>fslswapdim</code> can be used to fix it (see below).

<br><br><LI><b>fslswapdim</b> - this is an advanced tool that
re-orders the data storage to permit changes between axial, sagittal
and coronal slicing.  When used in this mode the same left-right
convention (also called coordinate handedness or
radiological/neurological convention) will be maintained <i>as long as
no warning is printed</i>.

<p>
The new orientation of the data is specified by selecting what the new
axes should represent.  This can either be done in terms of the old
axes (<kbd>x y z -x -y -z</kbd>) or in terms of anatomical labels
<i>when this information is available</i> (in a nifti image where
either the sform or qform code is non-zero).  The anatomical labels
are RL LR AP PA SI IS. Note that the anatomical label version will not
allow the left-right convention to be changed.

<p>
Ordinarily <kbd>fslswapdim</kbd> will change the orientation
information in the header as well as reordering the data.  This is so
that the anatomical labels stay attached to the same parts of the
image and not fixed to the voxel coordinates.  Hence, reordering a
coronal image to axial slicing should keep the labels correctly
attached to the relevant parts of the image, as long as they were
correct initially.  If the initial labels are incorrect (see the
labels in <kbd>fslview</kbd>) then <kbd>fslorient</kbd> needs to be
used in conjunction with <kbd>fslswapdim</kbd> in order to correct
this.

<p> When <kbd>fslswapdim</kbd> is given arguments that will change the
left-right orientation it will issue a warning that the left-right
orientation is being flipped.  It will also try to modify the
orientation information in the header (only when either the sform or
qform code is non-zero), but <i>not</i> in a way that swaps this
left-right orientation in the header.  Hence there is a net change in
orientation as the data is swapped while the header is not.  If the
swap occurs on the x-axis then nothing is done to the header at all.
Otherwise, the axis which is being swapped, together with the x-axis,
have their orientation changed.  In this way the handedness of the
header is preserved, the labels associated with the y-axis and z-axis
follow the image change, but the x-axis labels do not.  It is
recommended that if a left-right swap in storage is desired (and this
should only be done if the reconstruction is initially incorrect, and
cannot be fixed by finding any better conversion method) then the
arguments <kbd>-x y z</kbd> should be used as this is the simplest
form of swapping since it only affects the x-axis data and no labels
or header information is changed.

</UL>

<p>
<b>Serious (uncommon) problems</b>
<br>
<ol>
  <li><b>The labels in FSLView are wrong or missing and no conversion
  to NIfTI can fix this</b>
  <br>If this really cannot be fixed at the conversion stage, then it
  is possible to fix by the follow (only to be attempted after reading
  the following section on background information on NIfTI
  orientation):
  <br> <code>fslorient -deleteorient <i>imagename</i></code>
  <br> <code>fslswapdim <i>imagename</i> <i>a b c</i> <i>imagename</i></code>
  <br> <code>fslorient -setqformcode 1 <i>imagename</i></code>
  <br> where <i>a b c</i> need to be chosen, usually by trial and
  error, so that the image after this is in the same orientation (as
  viewed in FSLView) as the MNI152 images.  However, unless you have
  some way of telling left from right in the image (e.g. by a vitamin
  capsule or clearly known structural asymmetry) this method can
  easily result in an incorrect left-right labelling and so should not
  be attempted.
</ol>

<p>
<b>Background information on NIfTI Orientation</b>
<br>

This section is purely optional but is extremely useful to understand
if you are working with any of the advanced tools, have unusual
problems, or are just plain interested.

<p>

The NIfTI standard is confusing for many people on the issue of
orientation, largely because it is intrinsically a confusing issue.
It is complicated because the intensity data is stored on disk as a
list of numbers - there is no concept of spatial or anatomical
location with these numbers, and so information and standard
conventions are used to associate spatial and anatomical location
information with these numbers.

<p>

To start with, voxel coordinates are associated with the numbers (intensity values), such
that the first number is at coordinate (0,0,0) the second at (1,0,0),
the third at (2,0,0), etc.  So, for example, say the image was 64 by
64 by 20 in size, then the coordinates would go as (0,0,0) then
(1,0,0) ... then (63,0,0) then (0,1,0) then (1,1,0) then (2,1,0)
... then (63,1,0) then (0,2,0) ... then (63,63,0) then (0,0,1) then
(1,0,1) ... until (63,63,19).  Note that all coordinates start at 0,
not 1, and that the first coordinate (i) here is the one that
increases the fastest as you go through the list, followed by second
(j) and then the third (k).  These voxel coordinates - (i,j,k) - give
spatial information (using information about how many voxels are in
the three spatial directions) but do not attribute any anatomical
information at all.

<p>

To go from voxel coordinates to more anatomically meaningful
coordinates is the job of the <code>qform</code> and
<code>sform</code> matrices that are stored in the NIfTI file.  Note
that these matrices only provide useful information if they have a
non-zero <code>code</code>, since a zero <code>code</code> indicates
that the matrix is "Unknown" and hence cannot be used. Having two
matrices here is a common source of confusion. They were originally
proposed so that two different coordinates could be kept track of -
one representing the scanner coordinate system (the real space inside
the scanner bore) and the other one relating to standard space
coordinates (e.g. MNI152). However, in practice, it is rare that both
contain different information as they are often set to be the same, or
one of them is "Unknown" in which case the other contains all the
useful information.

<p>

Either matrix (qform or sform) is used to convert the voxel coordinates into
"real world" coordinates (also called continuous coordinates, or mm
coordinates, or other names).  These new coordinates - called (x,y,z)
here - have units of mm, and can take any values, not just positive
whole numbers like the (i,j,k) voxel coordinates.  Note that FSLView
displays both voxel and mm coordinates.
[Aside: the conversion is done by
multiplying the matrix with the voxel coordinate, reshaped as a 4x1
vector with the last element equal to 1 - although this detail is not
important for any of the discussion or understanding.]

<p>

If the <code>qform</code> (or <code>sform</code>) is set so that it
gives information about scanner coordinates (as indicated by the
<code>code</code>), then a standard convention is used to relate the
coordinate values to the anatomy.  The convention is: +x = Right; +y =
Anterior; +z = Superior.  That is, moving in the positive x-direction
(so that the x-coordinate increases) will be moving to the right,
etc.  This now allows left and right to be distinguished, which is
usually not possible just by looking at brain images.  Hence this
information is absolutely crucial and getting this right for the
conversion of the image to NIfTI format is extremely important.
If it is incorrect then it would be easy for left and right to be
assigned incorrectly and all analysis results to be on the wrong side.
The information from the <code>qform</code> and <code>sform</code>
is what is used by FSLView to determine the labels that are shown on
the image.

<p>

If the <code>sform</code> is set so that it gives information about
standard space coordinates then the situation is the same as above,
since the standard convention used above was chosen to be the same as
the convention chosen for the standard space coordinate systems
(MNI152 and Talairach).  The main difference between the two
situations is that the transformation to standard space (represented
by the <code>sform</code> matrix) also involves scaling and shearing
of the coordinate axes to make the brain "fit" the standard templates,
whereas the transformation to scanner space coordinates is normally just a
rotation and translation.

<p>

An aside on left-right conventions: it is possible to <i>store</i> an
image in many different ways that are totally and completely
equivalent in terms of the intensities and the (x,y,z) coordinates.
What can be different is the voxel coordinates (and hence the order of
the intensities stored in the file) but these are completely
unimportant for all analysis purposes - they are purely related to the
storage format, in this case NIfTI - only the (x,y,z) coordinates and
the intensity values count with respect to the analysis.  That being
said, one common confusion arises when the left-right order of the
storage is changed (but the mm coordinates and intensities are
unchanged).  For instance, imagine taking an image where the first
voxel is on the left and then swapping the left-right order so that
the new image is stored such that the first voxel is now the rightmost
one, but modifying the <code>qform</code> and <code>sform</code>
matrices appropriately so that this rightmost voxel still has the same
(x,y,z) coordinate as it had before - just a different voxel
coordinate.  This kind of change will not affect any analysis in FSL
or any programs that are fully NIfTI compliant.  However, some
programs are only happy with one sort of ordering (sometimes called
left-handed/right-handed, or radiological/neurological, or RAS/LAS,
etc.)
This used to be the case for old versions of FSL, but is no longer true.
But if only the order of the intensities in the file is swapped,
<i>without</i> compensating for this in the <code>sform</code> and
<code>qform</code> matrices, then the swapped version is no longer
equivalent to the original.  This is why both the data order and
header information need to be kept in sync, and why running either
<code>fslswapdim</code> or <code>fslorient</code> alone to change the
orientation information is dangerous and usually incorrect.

<p>

An aside on display orientation: everything that has been said above
about the NIfTI format refers to coordinates and data storage and has
<i>nothing</i> to do with what way the images can be <i>displayed</i>
in different viewing programs. Although the storage can be referred to
as "radiological" or "neurological" this does not mean anything with
respect to the displayed orientation.  A valid NIfTI image can be
displayed in any orientation that the viewing tool chooses, with the
left side of the brain shown on the right side of the screen (so
called radiological convention) or the other way around (neurological
convention).  It is also possible to display the inferior side of the
brain at the top of the image, or any other configuration.  It is
entirely up to the display software how it chooses to show the image
on the screen.  What the NIfTI format does do is provide information
to determine how to label the different parts of the image (with mm
coordinates or anatomical labels such as left, right, anterior,
posterior, superior and inferior).  As long as the display tool
correctly interprets this information and keeps it consistent with its
choice of display orientation, there is no conflict between any type
of NIfTI image and any displayed orientation.
